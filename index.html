        My Fridays usually start out with some class and then I hold a lecture
        for a new experimental class here at UMD, followed by office hours!
        &nbsp;
        I teach a class about how to prepare for interviews and be successful
        in interviews. The site for the class can be found

          This past Saturday I met up with some friends and played Magic: the
          Gathering all day, it's a blast! We ended the day by going out for
          dinner in Bethesda.
          <p>
          Magic is a trading card game and I will briefly explain the rules. The
          premise of the game is that each player is a wizard and can cast magic spells.
          The spells can be cast using mana which comes from mana sources like lands. The
          specifics will be explained more in detail later.
          <p>
          Usually each player brings his/her own deck of cards to a game. The game
          is played 1v1 but can also be played
          During a 2 player game each player takes a turn, the player that goes
          first is determined at random, and when playing best of 3, in the following
          games the player that lost the last game goes first.
          <p>
          Each player starts with 20 life and 7 cards in his/her hand. There are several
          different types of cards in Magic. The most fundamental card is a land card,
          it can be used, or tapped, for mana to cast spells. Land is usually untapped
          during the upkeep, or the start, of each turn. Mana comes in 5 different colors,
          red, black, blue, white, green, and colorless. It can be used to cast spells, or
          the cards in your hand. Everything in the game that isn't a land is a spell. It
          has the same principles as Hearthstone. Most spells (like creatures and sorceries)
          can only be cast during your main phase, but spells like instants can be cast during
          any phase of a turn.

        Sundays are usually when I unwind from all of the strenuous activities from the weekend. This is when I will work on my various
        art pieces and if the weather is nice, go outdoors and practice my photography. It's important for your mental health to have
        stress-relieving hobbies.
        <p>
        I like to take pictures of nature like these.

        When I get done with my Sunday stroll I like to unwind by listening to some
        Drake. He puts me in the mood with his silky voice. He sounds best next to
        some running water so usually I listen to him while crying in the shower.
